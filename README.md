# LYcode
This project includes a one-time address code as well as a log-sized ring signature algorithm code.

The project is based on the GO language and the gnark-crypto library. The language version is v1.24.1. The main.go file contains the algorithm related to the one-time address and amount encryption, and the MyRingSig.go file contains the algorithm related to ring signature.
